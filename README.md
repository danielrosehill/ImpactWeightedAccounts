# Impact Weighted Accounts: Datasets And Visualisations



![](images/negandpos.png)

*Above: an example visualisation derived from the Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative (IWAI) product impact dataset (2021). The left column shows companies with the most positive monetised impact created, organised from highest to lowest. The right column shows the companies with the most negative total monetised impact created, organised from "highest" (most negative) to lowest (least negative)*

This Github repository was created to host data releases and data visualisations for prospective impact-weighted accounting methodologies.

This project is a personal project and is not affiliated with any of the entities that may be mentioned here. 

Every effort has been made to offer proper attribution to the original authors of the datasets and work - and to distinguish between original data and analyses on those data.
