## 'Questions' Subfolder

The purpose of this subfolder is to house questions (in regular expression) that will be run against one or more of the datasets. 

For queries (in SQL)... see the 'queries' folder instead.

The questions will be organised according to which dataset they apply to and where possible will be compiled as 'to-do' lists in Markdown.
