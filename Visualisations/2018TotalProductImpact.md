# 2018 - Total Product Impact By Company: Most Positive, Most Negative 

**Summary:**

The following visualisation was generated from the Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative's 2021 product impact dataset (the dataset itself and extractions from it are nested under the `IWAI_Product_Impact_2021` folder):

**Interpretation:**

- On the left, it shows those companies with the most positive impacts, in dollar terms, for that year.
- On the right, it shows those companies with the most negative impacts, in dollar terms, for that year.

In simpler terms, according to the IWAI methodology:

- On the left, we see the companies that did the most good
- On the right, we see the companies that created the most damage 

## Guide To Coefficients Used

The IWAI product impact dataset uses the following coefficients to estimate companies' holistic 'impacts' through their operations (note: these are my own explanations for the variables)		:

| **Coefficient**   | Description                                                  | Research Methodology Link |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Affordability     | This attribute captures the extent to which the product is affordable for consumers. A company which makes health-promoting products available at a price point that is affordable for a local demographic, for example, is rewarded positively. | Coming soon               |
| Underserved       | This attribute captures the extent to which the product targets underserved populations. |                           |
| Health and Safety | Health and safety parameters are captured and monetised here. For example, health and safety breaches which put consumers at risk are monetised negatively through this coefficient/variable. |                           |
| Effectiveness     | This variable captures the extent to which products fulfil their intended purpose. |                           |
| Addiction         | This variable captures negatively purchasing of products that arises through states of presumed addiction. |                           |
| Pollutants        | This variable captures the damaging effects of polutants.    |                           |
| Recycling         | This variable can 'reward' or 'punish' companies based upon their efforts towards recycling and waste. |                           |
